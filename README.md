## ML done on mpg dataset of seaborn using python only

### In this I have provided one .ipynb file which you can run in your jupyter notebook
### Also there I have provided one in .pkl extension if you want to do it with vim editor
### I have done some data visualization for better understanding
### The prediction is done on considering only 3 features displacement,horsepower and weight you can add more features too
### More the features more accuracy of your machine will increase but they must have to be a good coorelation coefficient
